Things Done:
	 - Early camera movement:
		- W moves camera +1.0f in Y direction
		- S moves camera -1.0f in Y direction
		- A moves camera -1.0f in X direction
		- D moves camera +1.0f in X direction

	- add X,Y,Z axies 
		- red line is x-axis
		- blue line is y-axis
		- magenta line is z-axis


Things to Do:
	- Modify firework shader for matrix transformations
	- add mouse controls to move camera
	- fix keyboard controls; restrict movement in one direction
